Preface
=======

We have developed a computational infrastructure to handle converting
high volumes of raw Histoimmunogenetics Markup Language (HML) documents
to a hierarchical collection of Fast Health Interoperability Resources
(FHIR) based resources. This infrastructure is an ecosystem built around
open source principals and currently implemented in Java and Python. It
is theoretically possible to implement this project in any modern-day
object-oriented language or framework; however, for the purpose of this
implementation, the following prerequisites must be installed on a
bash-capable operating system. To aid in the adoption of this
implementation, we are currently writing build scripts that will execute
in a Windows environment through PowerShell. Please check for release
updates regularly as the development of this source code is an active
effort, we strongly recommend staying up to date with current code
releases.

Docker
======

EASY IMAGE PULL

At the root of this directory, there is a docker-compose.yml file. Simply execute the following after installing Docker:

    "docker-compose up"
    
This will pull published images from the Docker Hub, this will build and launch the application on your local machine. Navigate to: 0.0.0.0:9005 to use the application.

Prerequisites:
---------------

-   Docker <http://www.docker.com>

Docker
======

LOCAL BUILDS

Prerequisites:
---------------

-   Maven v3.x+ <https://maven.apache.org>
-   Python v2.7x+ <https://www.python.org> **
-   Java 8 <http://www.oracle.com> **

(** = Only needed if compling code from source)

To easily build this application via Docker-Compose, please simply execute:
 
    "sh intsall.sh"
    
Running this script assumes you have Maven 3.+ installed, if you do not have Maven, or do not with to install Maven, there are .jar files included at the 'local' directory. Simply modify the Dockerfile's of their parent project to point to these jars. This will handle building docker images and start docker-compose via the up command with all necessary container linkage. You will then need to create databases and collections in MongoDb. To accomplish this, there is a script located in the "mongo" directory. Simply run:

    "python CreateDatabse.py"
    
You are now ready to import hml files that will be convered, and/or submitted to a FHIR conformance server.

Environment Setup
=================

This conversion infrastructure is designed to run in an environment
consisting of a high-throughput message bus system, a map-reduce capable
schemaless database, and a series of RESTful Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs). We have chosen the following open-sourced projects to
satisfy environmental requirements:

-   Apache Kafka: high-throughput message bus
<https://kafka.apache.org>

-   MongoDB: schemaless map-reduce capable database
<https://www.mongodb.org>

-   Spring Framework: RESTful API framework
<http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot>

Kafka Setup:
------------

1.  Download Kafka v0.10.2.1 (<https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)>

2.  Unzip, and copy the contents (3 files) of 'kafka-setup' directory
included in this repository to 'kafka\_2.12-0.10.2.1/config' located
in the kafka distribution downloaded in step 1

3.  Start a single instance of zookeeper: 'bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh
config/zookeeper.properties'

4.  Start a cluster of Kafka message brokers: 'bin/kafka-server-start.sh
config/server.properties & bin/kafka-server-start.sh
config/server-1.properties & bin/kafka-server-start.sh
config/server-2.properties'

5.  This project depends on the creation of 3 topics: 1)
hml-fhir-conversion 2) fhir-hml-conversion 3) fhir-submission

6.  We strongly recommend the following replication schema for the
creation of topics in step 5: 3 partitions, 3 replicates

7.  Kafka Tool is an excellent GUI based administrative tool for
managing your Kafka cluster, we recommend the creation of topics by
this mechanism rather than the command line based approach
(<http://www.kafkatool.com)>

MongoDB Setup:
--------------

1.  Download MongoDB v3.4.6 binary distribution
(<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)>

2.  Extract files from download in step 1

3.  Copy files to desired target directory

4.  Create a directory to house Mongo databases (recommend:
/Database/Mongo)

5.  Execute 'mongodb ---dbpath={PATH\_TO\_DIRECTORY\_IN\_STEP\_4}' from
the target directory where binaries were copied

6.  Execute the script (mongodb-setup/create\_databases.js) included in
this release

7.  We recommend the using MongoChef (https://studio3t.com) as a GUI to
administer and manage your mongo database

Building and Running RESTful APIs
=================================

Currently, there are 3 RESTful APIs that require building, installing,
and running to support the implementation of this conversion system. The
procedure to build, install, and run each of these APIs is identical and
can be executed independently of one another to support ongoing
development efforts, or built in a batch. To execute a batch build and
install, simply download the repository marked '\*parent' below.

API Repositories:
------------------

-   service-hml-fhir-converter-parent (\*parent)
(<https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/service-hml-fhir-converter-parent.git)>

-   service-hml-fhir-converter-api
(<https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/service-hml-fhir-converter-api.git)>

-   service-hml-fhir-converter
(<https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/service-hml-fhir-converter.git)>

-   service-fhir-submission
(<https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/service-fhir-submission.git)>

"Parent"-Install Process:
-------------------------

1.  From service-hml-fhir-converter-parent directory, execute: 'python
Setup.py \[options\]'
           
           2.  Options are not required for building, 'python Setup.py' is adequate
           to begin process
           
           3.  Please see documentation for detailed explanation of optional build
           parameters
           (<https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/service-hml-fhir-converter-parent)>
           
           Individual Module Install Process:
           ----------------------------------
           
           1.  From directory of module source, execute: 'sh install.sh'
           
           2.  To only execute build action, execute: 'sh build.sh'
           
           After installing, the executable Java Archive (JAR, .jar)
           (/target/\[repository-name-version.jar\] file can be run simply by
           executing 'java --jar \[PATH\_TO\_JAR\]'. Optionally, the '-r' flag can
           be passed, telling the install scripts to begin running the API server
           after install successfully completes.
           
           Building and Running Graphical User Interface (GUI) Tools:
           ==========================================================
           
           ### web-hml-fhir-converter
           
           In an effort to both aid in the correct input of HML and FHIR data
           structures, we have created a GUI tool that currently supports the
           inputting of data through web forms. This data has machine-learning
           capability for auto-completion of structured data contained in various
           properties of an HML document. As the database grows in size and
           diversity, predictions to commonly populated discreet values can be
           obtained by entering the first few characters of its value. This future
           goal of this tool is support both the structured input of FHIR and HML
           as an entry point to creating mock data for use in the conversion
           ecosystem.
           
           ### web-hml-fhir-conversion-dashboard
           
           In an effort to guide non-developer users of this conversion ecosystem,
           we have created a GUI tool that is capable of submitting files
           containing HML or FHIR data for conversion. This allows for the
           submission of FHIR or HML data into a conversion queue and tracks its
           status. Status results are returned as successful, processing, or error.
           Should an error be encountered, specific data on what caused the
           exception to fail the message is recorded and will be available to the
           user. After the conversion process has successfully completed, a file is
           available to download as either an HML document in XML or JSON format or
           FHIR a structured FHIR object that contains relational data for
           subsequent submission to a FHIR conformance server (XML or JSON). It is
           important to note at the time of writing this document, the FHIR
           conformance submission is an ongoing development effort and has not
           reached release status.

           Building and Running Kafka Consumer Processes
           =============================================
           
           Currently, there are 3 Kafka consumer APIs that require building,
           installing, and running to support the implementation of this conversion
           system. The procedure to build, install, and run each of these APIs is
           identical and can be executed independently of one another to support
           ongoing development efforts, or built in a batch. To execute a batch
           build and install, simply download the repository marked '\*parent'

           2.  To only execute build action, execute: 'sh build.sh'
           
           After installing, the executable Java Archive (JAR, .jar)
           (/target/\[repository-name-version.jar\] file can be run simply by
           executing 'java --jar \[PATH\_TO\_JAR\]'. Optionally, the '-r' flag can
